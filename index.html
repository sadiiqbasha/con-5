            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        
            <p>
            This chapter has identified significant issues related to online distance learning for educators, learners, and program planners. It synthesized information from a growing literature base and included the results
of several studies that the authors have completed. But this article only
reflects the beginning of the trend towards online distance learning. Postsecondary institutions are under pressure to provide greater access to
educational opportunities, and they face intense competition from industry and for-profit companies for students’ attention. This pressure may
cause decisions to be made without full consideration, and the authors
suggest that larger ethical, legal, and social questions have yet to be
answered. Some of these include:<br>

            · What will happen to intellectual property rights of professors who locate
their resources online?<br>
· Is it possible that less skilled workers might be hired to deliver these
courses (Noble, 1998)?<br>
· Will students become “guinea pigs” in experimental trials of online
courses?<br>
· Should students be paid for their participation, or at least be allowed to
take the courses for free?<br>
· Is it possible that education will become a compilation of individual
courses, rather a broader whole that is greater than the sum of its parts?
The possibilities in the online world are immeasurable. Educators and the
public at large have an opportunity to take a proactive stand in the development of courses and programs to insure that they are pedagogically sound,
organizationally strong, and programmatically effective. The result will be
the best possible online distance learning environments.

            <h1>A Case Study in Managing a
Distance Education
Consortium</h1>
        <h4>Vicky A. Seehusen

            <p>
            This chapter describes the unique distance education consortium called
CCCOnline developed by the Community Colleges of Colorado System (CC
of C). CC of C is comprised of 14 Colorado Community Colleges and delivers
courses, certificates and degrees to more than 250,000 students per year. The
CCCOnline consortium, managed by the Colorado Electronic Community
College (CECC), provides centralized management of faculty and curriculum
and the consortial member colleges provide most of the student services to
their students enrolled in the program.<br>This chapter traces the organizational evolution of CCCOnline.
CCCOnline was very much a “top-down” creation. It was also built very
quickly. The creators of CCCOnline believed that speed was necessary to get
educational offerings online and that internal relationships could be dealt with
later. Neuhauser, Bender, and Stromberg (2000) echo this belief. They state
that adding an e-business to traditional business creates a parallel culture.
Furthermore, they believe that, at present, many consumers seem to accept
that new products will have a few bugs and that the key is to figure out how
to deliver speed and quality over the long run.<br>At the time CCCOnline was created, there was little information about
designing online distance education consortia. Witherspoon (1996) had
compiled a planner’s casebook that included real world experiences of a
